# Bash Scripting Notes - Arguments 

# Generic example of user input 

#!/bin/bash 

echo "You entered the argument: $1, $2, $3 and $4"             # run the script and add anything you want to the name of the file like so


./test.sh hello hi heya yo
You entered argument: hello, hi, heya and yo.

ls -lh $1                                                       # pass the argument to ls -lh -- this is useless but a decent example of passing arguments

#!/bin/bash

lines=$(ls -lh $1 | wc -l)                                      # Gather number of objects in a directory (you pass in the dir as an argument)

echo "You have $(($lines-1)) objects in the $1 directory."      # Tell the user how many objects there are

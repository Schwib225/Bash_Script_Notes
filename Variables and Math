# Shell Scripting Notes - Variables and Math


# Variable setting and references 

testing='1.. 2.. 3..'
echo $testing           # Reference a variable

files=$(ls)             # This will listall files from the ls command

now=$(date)             # This will get the date/time of the system and list it as the now variable
echo $now               # This will post it

#!/bin/sh
# Another example with asking for user input 

echo "what is your name?"
read person                     # This will get user input and create variable 'PERSON'
echo "Hello, $person"

# Finding System Declared Variables

env                             # Will list all current variables, even ones defined in terminal session 


# Math expressions

expr 30 + 10                    # This will add the two numbers
expr 30 - 10                    # Will subtract
expr 30 / 10                    # Will divide
expr 100 \* 10                  # Will multiply, need to escape the *

# Math - With variables now

mynum1=100
expr $mynum1 + 50
mynum2=88
expr $mynum1 \* $mynum2

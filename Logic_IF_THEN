# Different values

man test        # Man page for the brackets [] of IF logic 

eq      # Equals
gt      # Greater than
ge      # Greater than/equal
lt      # Less than
le      # Less than/equal
ne      # Not equal 

# Another example - Search for the existance of a file using the -f option

if [ -f ~/myfile ]
then 
    echo "The file exists"
else

# Example - Checking for a command on the system

#!/bin/bash

command=/usr/bin/htop 

if [ -f $command ] 
#if command -v $command                                         # This achieves the same thing as the previous statement - checks for the existance of htop/looks like 'which' output
then
    echo "$command is available, let's run it..."
else
    echo "$command is not available, installing it..."
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y htop                 # the && chains commands together if the first is successful
fi 

$command                                                        # This will run htop immediately after completing the if/then statement
